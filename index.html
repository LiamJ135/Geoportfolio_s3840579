		This is my geoportfolio which was made for the subject Professional Practice (GEOMODO). The website contains information about what i have achieved in my 
		4 years studying at RMIT.
		<p>
		Hi, My Name is Liam Jones and as of March 2023, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. My Surveying related interests is working with robotic total stations, collection and analysis of
		spatial information, drafting survey plans and and being able to do so by getting out in the field. My current capstone research projects involes creating a
		report about the use of Unmanned Survey Vessels (USV's) for hydrographic surveys. this is done via research of current scientific papers and by working with
		a hydrographic survey company, Bintang Subsea who use their own USV to perform hydrpgraphic surveys.
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include camping, travelling, fishing and working in the shed!

	<div class="academic-intro">
		Cadastral Surveying involves re-establishing title boundaries where tey were first set out when the boundary was first established.
		This is extrememely important for the dimensions of property boundaries and showing land owners the extent of their ownership. this
		process adopts a variety of skills including conducting field surveys, survey mathematics and drafting. These skills were applied 
		assignments where a re-establishment of road allignments was need in the town of Talbot.
		<ul>
			<li>Practical 1: conduct a field survey of the crown allotment</li>
			<li>Lab sessions: reducing and adjusting survey data, and re establishing road allignments</li>
			<li>Draft a survey plan of re-establishemnt and report to justify the choices made</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Below are the outputs of my work for the re-establishment assignment.

	<!--SUBJECT 2-->

	<div class="bar"><h2>Engineering Surveying (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you gave done yourself-->
	<div class="academic-intro">
		Engineering surveying is a 4th year subject that focuses on the engineering side of surveying. This includes areas such as:
		<ul>
			<li>construction</li>
			<li>mining (GIS)</li>
			<li>Road design</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		When i was completing the subject, once key assignemt reuqired us to design and set out a road. Some off the steps taken include:
		<ul>
			<li>mathematical design of the road layout</li>
			<li>draft and road design plan</li>
			<li>set out the road design usng survey equipment</li>
			<li>produce a report of the outcome of the project</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The road design was created utilising feature survey information collected at the proposed site and was design to
			meet certain key criteria. LISCAD was used to design the road and the computed design was important into CAD
			software to form a road design plan and supporting set-out information. This information was then used to set out
			the road using robotic total stations, tapes and other survey equipment. After the setout was complete, a report
			commenting on the quality of the process was written.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2023) within the sureying industry. My only experience was
		had a Lewis Land Surveying (LLS) which is a small surveying company based in thomastown. I have worked at LLS for over 2 years
		casually in between my university classes.

	<div class="job-overview">
		I was lucky to get a position at Lewis Land Surveying in late 2021 through a friend who worked their and was also in my class at
		university. At LLS my role was an assistant surveyor, which required me to to prepare the survey equipment for jobs, set-up and
		operate the robotic total stations, draw sketches of the property under survey and its features and in some cases reduce data.
		I quickly became confident in my role as an assistant and soon began to party lead survey jobs, and draft plans to be sent to
		the client.
		<p>
		My work at LLS was invaluable to my learning and studies at university. Both the expereince i gained in the survey industry and
		the theory helped one another as i was able to apply knowledge from both of these areas to further my learning.
